# Library

### This is a project from the Full Stack Javascript course on "The Odin Project". In this project, I built a library using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Difficulties throught the project
- The initial approach in building the functionality of the page was difficult as I didn't know where to start, which was the biggest problem I found building the project.
- I had a problem making the functionality of the "read" button work as the text wouldn't change.
- Also had a problem with the delete funtionality as it wouldn't work in most of my approaches.
